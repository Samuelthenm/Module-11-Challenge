# My Note Taker (Module 11)


## Description 
Welcome to the Note Taker application! This tool helps you write, save, and organize your notes efficiently. Built using Express.js for the back end, it allows users to create, store, and delete notes seamlessly. When you open the application, you see the start page that says My Note Taker!! Then when you click 'Start' you can view existing notes on the left side of the screen while entering new ones on the right. A "Save Note" button allows you to store your notes, and a "Clear Form" button lets you reset the input fields. Saved notes remain listed on the left for easy access, and clicking a note loads it back into the editor. You can also delete notes you no longer need.
This simple yet powerful application ensures you never lose track of important thoughts or tasks!
